# Essential Salary-Negotiation Terms to Know Before Entering Talks

## Key terms and definitions
- Base salary: The fixed annual salary before any extras or bonuses. This is the core number to negotiate. 
- Total compensation: All monetary and non-m monetary rewards you receive (base salary, bonuses, stock, signing bonus, overtime, overtime pay, commissions, benefits). 
- Salary range: The span between the minimum and maximum pay the employer considers for a role; useful for anchoring discussions. 
- Market rate / market value: Typical compensation for a similar role in the same industry and geography, based on reliable data sources. 
- Benchmarking data: Verified salary data (e.g., salary bands by title, location, experience) used to justify asks. 
- Cost of living adjustment (COLA): An adjustment to salary to reflect differences in living costs between locations or times. 
- Signing bonus: A one-time payment at start of employment, often used to boost total compensation without changing base salary. 
- Annual bonus / incentive: Performance-based or discretionary pay that complements base salary, often a percentage of base. 
- Equity / stock options: Ownership shares in the company, typically awarded to align long-term incentives; value depends on vesting schedule and company performance. 
- Vesting schedule: Timeline over which equity or options become fully owned by the employee. 
- Benefits package: Non-salary compensation including health insurance, retirement contributions, life/disability insurance, gym, wellness stipends, etc. 
- Perks: Non-monetary value like flexible hours, remote work, additional PTO, professional development budgets. 
- Non-compete / non-solicit: Legal restrictions that may affect future employment or opportunities; important to understand implications. 
- Counteroffer: A response to an offer that presents a revised package or terms in negotiation. 
- Walk-away / BATNA (Best Alternative To a Negotiated Agreement): The strongest alternative if negotiations fail; what you’ll do if no deal is reached. 
- Anchoring: Setting a starting point first to influence the negotiation range. 
- Concessions: Items you’re willing to trade or concede in exchange for gains elsewhere. 
- Salary band: A range within which the employer is willing to pay for a given role, sometimes linked to experience level. 
- Market correction: When pay levels adjust up or down due to supply/demand or inflation. 
- Non-monetary value: Aspects like growth opportunities, mentorship, brand reputation, or flexible schedule that add worth beyond money. 

## Practical tips
- Research sources: Use multiple data points (salary surveys, job postings, industry reports) to establish a credible baseline. 
- Separate past from future earnings: Focus on the role’s responsibilities and market value rather than past compensation. 
- Think in total value: If base salary is capped, negotiate for higher bonus potential, equity, or better benefits and work-life perks. 
- Prepare a range: Target a realistic baseline with a stretch goal, and know your BATNA. 
- Practice phrasing: Use calm, professional language to express expectations and rationale without sounding confrontational.
